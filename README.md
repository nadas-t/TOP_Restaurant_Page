# TOP_Restaurant_Page

This project, inspired by The Odin Project's "Restaurant Page" lesson, is a dynamic single-page application (SPA) built entirely with JavaScript. Instead of relying on multiple HTML pages, all content is generated and managed through JavaScript, demonstrating a strong grasp of DOM manipulation and modular code organization.

Features

  Dynamic Content Loading: All page content (Home, Menu, Contact) is created and updated using JavaScript, providing a seamless user experience without full page reloads.

  Modular Structure: The project is organized into separate JavaScript modules for each section (e.g., home.js, menu.js, contact.js), promoting clean, maintainable, and           reusable code.

  Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a great viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

  Interactive Menu: A sample menu section showcasing various dishes with descriptions, prices, and images.

  Contact Information: A dedicated contact page providing essential details for customer inquiries.

Technologies Used

  HTML5: For the basic page structure.

  CSS3: For styling and responsiveness.

  JavaScript (ES6+): The core language for all dynamic content generation and interaction.

  Webpack: Used as a module bundler to compile and optimize JavaScript, CSS, and image assets for production.
